## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->
Girt with a boyish garb for boyish task,  
Eager she wields her spade: yet loves as well  
Rest on a friendly knee, intent to ask  
The tale he loves to tell.  
Rude spirits of the seething outer strife  
  

## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->
He halted in the wind, and -- what was that  
Far in the maples, pale, but not a ghost?  
He stood there bringing March against his thought,  
And yet too ready to believe the most.  
  
"Oh, that's the Paradise-in-bloom," I said;  
  

## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem of your choice 8-20 lines,here!-->
